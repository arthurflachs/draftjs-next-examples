# draft-js-next-examples

The purpose of this repository is to experiment with [draft-js](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js) through [the examples of the main repo](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/blob/master/examples/draft-0-10-0). The examples seemed a bit old and the goal is to reuse them inside a modern react app, using [next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/).
